***

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I've been able to create a snake like model that is able to be moved by the user.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Have not created an objective for the game yet, or more so generate an objective for the user to follow. I have also not created a scorekeeper type HUD. Have not adjusted the speed of the snake when objective is completed or a way for the user to fail the game.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Have not encountered any problems as of lately, only time consuming for the project.
