# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Snake To Objective 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game where the user controls a snake and scores objectives

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
The software I will create is a small game that will let the user control a model resembling a snake, using directional keys in order to move the snake around.
From there, objectives such as squares around the software will require the user to control the snake to head towards those squares to earn a score. Ultimately, 
the goal for the user is to collect as much squares as possible. 


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

None

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

None

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

What I plan to accomplish no matter what is the the snake model, for the user to atleast experience the ability to control the model around the software even if
there is no objective listed or something to score. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Expanding from the above statement, if I can create the ability for the user to move the snake freely, then a better outcome would be if I can implement the ability for the snake's speed to increase and if the user fails to control this speed, will fail and need to start over. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

If I do manage to complete the project ahead of time, I hope to add more features to the software, possibly detailing the snake further or creating various shapes
instead of one, while also creating a much more detailed score keeper. Another thing I have in mind, is the ability to increase the snake's speed as the user
continously captures objectives.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

In my next steps, I will utilize what we have learned in class already and research various videos that cover this game. Many have created this game and I believe I will learn best if I can see how the snake model is created along with my other goals such as creating the ability to play the game in general, not just to control the snake and do nothing. From there, I will utilize this information and create my own code while also further researching movement based python games, score keeping, and HUD to further improve the outcome of my final project.
